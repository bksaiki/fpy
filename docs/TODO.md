Frontend:
 - fpc2fpy:
   - clean up names
 - parser:
   - fix ISSUE#1
   - use variables in the defining namespace
 - language:
   - preconditions?

Middle-end:
 - do we really need a separate AST / IR?

Backend:
 - fpc:
    - properties
    - fuse let expressions
    - detect multi-variable while loops
    - detect multi-variable for loops
