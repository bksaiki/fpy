==================

**FPy** (fpy2) is a Python library for specifying and simulating
numerical algorithms with a focus on number systems and rounding.

It provides three major features:

* an embedded domain-specific language (DSL);
* a library of different number systems;
* a compiler to other languages and formats.

This documentation covers FPy's interface, examples, and general tips for users.
